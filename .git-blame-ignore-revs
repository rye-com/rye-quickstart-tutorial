# Since git v2.23 (August 2019), git-blame has a feature
# to ignore or bypass certain commits.
#
# This file contains a list of commits that are not likely what you
# are looking for in a blame, such as mass reformatting or renaming.
#
# These settings only apply once you've run an install once.
#
# `yarn install` will add this to your local tesseract/.git/config file
#
# Github actually will actually also take this specific file into account:
#   https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view

# Format code with prettier v2.7.1
